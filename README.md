## Project Overview
This repository contains a data analytics project focused on **influenza trends** in the United States. The goal is to help a medical staffing agency plan for surges in patient volume during flu season by analyzing historical data on:
- Influenza-related deaths
- Population demographics
- Influenza test results

By understanding **when** and **where** demand may spike, the agency can dispatch temporary healthcare staff efficiently.

## Objectives
- **Identify High-Risk Populations**: Examine the relationship between **elderly population (65+ years)** and **influenza-related mortality**.  
- **Determine Seasonality**: Analyze **seasonal trends** to predict peaks in influenza activity.  
- **Optimize Staffing**: Provide evidence-based recommendations to allocate medical personnel.

---

## Data Sources
1. **Influenza Deaths by Geography**  
   - **Source**: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  
   - **Description**: State-level counts of influenza-related deaths for multiple years.  
   - **Limitations**: Underreporting or inconsistent cause-of-death classification can skew results.    

2. **Population Data by State and Age**  
   - **Source**: US Census Bureau  
   - **Description**: Provides population estimates by state, age group, and sex.  
   - **Limitations**: Estimates may not fully account for migration or undercounting.  
     
3. **Influenza Laboratory Test Results**  
   - **Source**: CDC FluView  
   - **Description**: Survey-based weekly data on influenza test results by state.  
   - **Limitations**: Limited to reported tests; may not reflect the true total number of cases.   

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized column names.  
   - Ensured consistent date formats and merged data on common state identifiers.

2. **Descriptive Analysis**  
   - Calculated **mean**, **median**, **standard deviation**, and identified potential outliers.  
   - Assessed distributions (normal vs. skewed) for mortality and population data.

3. **Correlation & Hypothesis Testing**  
   - **Pearson correlation** was used to measure relationships between elderly population (65+, 85+) and total influenza deaths.  
   - **T-tests** were conducted to check if these correlations were statistically significant.

4. **Seasonality & Forecasting**  
   - Time-series plots generated to reveal seasonal peaks in influenza cases.  
   - Basic predictive modeling (e.g., moving averages) to estimate staffing needs.

5. **Data Visualization**  
   - Developed plots and charts to communicate findings effectively.  
   - Tools: **Tableau**, **Matplotlib**, or **Seaborn** (depending on the pipeline preferences).

---

## Key Findings
- **Age Is a Key Factor**: States with higher proportions of elderly residents (65+ or 85+) experience **higher influenza-related deaths**, with correlation coefficients up to 0.95.  
- **Statistically Significant**: T-test results yield extremely small p-values (< 0.05), reinforcing that the observed correlation is not by chance.  
- **Seasonal Peaks**: Data shows consistent spikes in influenza around **late fall to early spring**, suggesting targeted staffing in Q4 and Q1 each year.

## Insights and Next Steps
1. **Prioritize Vaccination Efforts**  
   - Focus on states with the largest elderly populations (65+).  

2. **Targeted Staffing**  
   - Deploy higher staffing levels in late autumn through spring, aligning with peak flu activity.

3. **Further Analysis**  
   - Explore **confounding variables** (e.g., vaccination rates, healthcare access, socioeconomic factors).  
   - Conduct **urban vs. rural** breakdowns and examine local hospitalization rates.

4. **Long-Term Recommendations**  
   - Develop robust **predictive models** (ARIMA, Prophet, or ML-based approaches) for future flu seasons.  
   - Integrate real-time CDC data to **dynamically adjust** staffing levels.
